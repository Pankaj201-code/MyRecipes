Step 1 : Prepare the filling
To make delicious Aloo Paratha, boil the potatoes at least a few hours before you plan to make the parathas and mash them in a large bowl and cover and refrigerate. Take them out from the fridge and add chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder, and red chilli powder. Mix well so that no lumps remain. Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions or the filling will fall out.


Step 2 : Knead a soft dough and roll a chapati and fill with the stuffing
Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and round it with your fingers. Now roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas. Apply the pressure very evenly and gently on all sides. Press very lightly so that the mixture does not come out.


Step 3 : Pan fry the Aloo Paratha
Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both the sides with a spoonful of ghee. If you want to use less ghee on the parathas, first roast them on both the sides on low flame and when they are slightly crispy, apply ghee with a kitchen brush on both the sides. You must keep the flame low.


Step 4 : Serve hot with curd, pickle and chutney
Serve piping hot with chilled yoghurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with aloo ka paratha. You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with this paratha.
